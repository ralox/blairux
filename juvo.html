        <h2>CHI Student Competition Project</h2>
        <p>Student-athletes usually experience psychological issues during their injured period, which play important roles in their rehabilitation. The three major challenges are the loss of identity, isolation, and inability to understand and communicate their recovery progress between checkups. 
        To assist the injured athletes, we propose AthleteJuvo, a collaborative gaming solution incorporating routine rehabilitation exercises, team competition, and social supports. Specifically, AthleteJuvo utilizes the competitive nature of athletes to gamify the rehabilitation process. Athletes rebuild their identity by forming a team with other injured athletes to compete with their rival schools. AthleteJuvo also helps injured athletes meet nearby injured athletes and connect back with their non-injured team members by sending challenges. To aid in recovery, AthleteJuvo uses wearable sensing fabric which collects and report movement data to the athlete’s therapist.</p>

        <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
        <h3>Injury is 1% physical and 99% psychological</h3>
        <p>For student athletes, getting injured is not only about physical influence but also psychologically and socially. Since most of an athlete’s daily schedule is team-centered, once they get injured, they miss the social interactions they would have had otherwise. Without their regular training and practice, athletes also miss the element of competition in their lives.
        <br>The key problems we aim to solve include:
            <ul>
                <li>The isolation and the feeling of uselessness during the injured period</li>
                <li>The inconvenient methods of getting advice from athletes with similar experience</li>
                <li>The inability to understand their rehab progress</li>
            </ul></p>

        <h2>Solution at a Glance</h2>
        <h3>A community for injured athletes to talk, meet up and share information.</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to help injured athletes overcome the psychological issues and strengthen the social support and information they need during their rehabilitation.</p>

        <h1>Design Process</h1>
        <h2>Understand the problems</h2>
        <p>To understand the problems injured athletes encountered in a broader sense, we conducted an online survey where the access was limited to injured athletes only; and held semi-structured interviews, including expert interviews and interviews with injured athletes.</p>    
        <div class="stats">
            <p class="number">87<br>Survey responses</p>
            <p class="number">2<br>Expert interviews</p>

<div class="bg_ivory">
        <h2>Preliminary Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>The results from the survey, expert interview and injured athletes interview shed light on our design directions. We concluded that the core problems injured athletes encounter could be separated into two dimensions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Psychological issues: being excluded from the team-centered activities causes isolation and feelings of uselessness, due to the inability to contribute to team activities.</li>
            <li>Physical recovery: The rehabilitation progress would affect both their physical rehabilitation performance and their mental health, therefore it is crucial for them to be aware of their performance during the rehabilitation.</li>
        </ul>

</div>
<div class="bg_white">
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There were 96.5% of the respondents who replied that the injury affected their psychological well-being.</li>
            <li>92% of them reported suffering from depression and isolation during their rehabilitation.</li>
            <li>The feeling of being isolated stems from the inability to participate in team activities during the rehabilitation.</li>
            <li>The feeling of loss of identity derives from lacking the opportunities to work with their team members and compete against rivals.</li>
            <li>They seek help from people who have similar experiences.</li>
            <li>They can't monitor the rehab progress well by paper-based tracking sheets.</li>
            <li>Not seeing the recovery progress sometimes leads to motivation lost.</li>
            <li>Besides the conclusion drew from our own data, I reviewed previous research from Stanford and made sure we focused on the right problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Brainstorming &amp; Storyboard</h2>
        <p>Based on our research findings, I led the brainstorming meeting with my teammates. I utilized the technique called <b>"How Might We"</b> to provoke thoughts. After everyone wrote down the "how might we" questions, each of us listed ideas and their pros and cons. We also made storyboards to see problems from the users' perspective. The final focus was to build a community for injured athletes to talk, meet up and share information.</p>

        <h3>Gamification</h3>
        <p>We utilized the competitive nature of athletes to gamify the rehabilitation process.</p>
        <h3>Connection</h3>
        <p>Our participants reported they tried to seek help from people who may have similar experiences, and to meet other injured athletes either online or offline to exchange information or get emotional support. Our design goal, therefore, was to help them connect with each other.</p>

<div class="bg_white">
        <h2>Task Flow</h2>
        <p>Before creating wireframes, I created the task flow to make sure all the steps were considered.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep a rehabilitation exercise log using a wearable sensing fabric patch</li>
            <li>Gamify the rehabilitation process</li>
            <li>Build a sense of competition in athletes - Compete in rehabilitation exercise against their rival school</li>
            <li>Instill a sense of cooperation - Form a team with injured athletes from the same school</li>
            <li>Encourage athletes to do their rehabilitation exercise regularly</li>
            <li>Search for and meet nearby injured athletes</li>
        </ul>
</div>
<div class="bg_white">
        <h2>User testing</h2>
        <h3>Wizard of Oz</h3>
        <p>We went through two iterations to test our design solutions. First, I created wireframes and printed it out as a paper prototype. I then invited 5 participants to test the prototype. The participants were asked to perform the following tasks, with our team members using a Wizard of Oz technique:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attaching the sensing fabric on any of their joints or muscles, and starting the rehabilitation exercise</li>
            <li>Checking their daily rehabilitation progress and team scores</li>
            <li>Checking nearby injured athletes and inviting them to do rehabilitation exercises together</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/Juvo_ite1.png" alt="Paperprototype 1"></div>

        </div>

        <h3>Feedback gained from the wireframes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Users pointed out that besides timer, the app should help with counting the repeats.</li>
            <li>Besides to know the assigned exercises, they wanted to know team scores as well.</li>
            <li>Besides connecting with each other, they hope there's a injured athletes community.</li>
            <li>The app should have progress visualization.</li>
            <li>They couldn't know other injured athletes' locations at a glance.</li>
            <li>They wanted to know what kind of sports others play.</li>
        </ul>
</div>

<div class="bg_ivory">
        <h2>Design refinement</h2>
        <p>Based on the feedback, I made our second iteration. This time, participants could see the team scores, use the exercise counting, see others on a map, sports other athletes play, a forum feature, and a long-term progress visualization.</p>
        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/Juvo_ite2.png" alt="wireframe 2"></div>
        </div>
        <h3>Feedback gained from the prototype</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants found the team scores were not easy to understand.</li>
            <li>It's still hard to interpret other users' locations.</li>
            <li>They also wanted a feature that can help them identify problems in their rehab exercises.</li>
            <li>The rehab progress visualization was great, but weekly progress is not long enough to see much difference.</li>
        </ul>
</div>

<div class="bg_white">
    <h2>Design refinement from the mid-fi prototype</h2>
        <p>We decided to add a recording feature, so the injured athletes can share their exercises with the community and ask for suggestions. I also added a calendar view of monthly progress visualization, and another way to present users on a map.</p>
        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/Juvo_ite3.png" alt="wireframe 2"></div>
        </div>
        <h3>Feedback gained from the prototype</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants like the feature that they can follow the animated instructions and record themselves at the same time.</li>
            <li>They had no more trouble understanding the other users' location.</li>
            <li>Calendar visualization provided more specific information, while the line graph summarized well of the rehab progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Decisions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Participants can decide whether they want to record the rehab exercise, the app would show the animation and the carema recording at the same time.</li>
            <li>Using a calendr to keep a daily track is useful, but a line chart should be available when users want to check their long-term progress.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>AthleteJuvo won the Honorable Mention at the UMSI ExpoSItion 2018 from 60+ teams. The design, though was not selected into the CHI student competition final round, got a lot of positive feedback from the reviewers.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>What we could have done better is to think how the "non-injured team members” would benefit from using the app, and how to better motivate them for using it. We could also narrow the scope more, focusing on specified injury types. Also, due to the time constraints, we could not involve the therapist over the development and evaluation process.</p>
